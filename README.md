# 📂 Dataset Description & Data Structure

### 📌 Data Source:

- **Source**: Internal company database
- **Format**: `.csv`

## 📊 Data Structure & Relationships  

To effectively analyze sales performance and customer behavior, the dataset was structured into a **star schema**, with **Sales.SalesOrderDetail** serving as the **Fact_Sales** table. This central fact table connects to multiple **dimension tables** to enhance data granularity and improve analytical capabilities. 

The **Fact_Sales** table is at the center of the star schema, connecting to multiple dimension tables via **foreign key relationships**

# 🧠 Design Thinking Process  

### 1️⃣ Empathize – Understanding Stakeholders’ Needs  

To ensure the dashboard meets business needs, I analyzed stakeholder concerns using the **5W1H framework** and an **Empathy Map**.  
##### 🔍 5W1H Analysis

### 2️⃣ Define – Establishing Key Metrics & Growth Formula  

#### 🎯 North Star Metric: Defining Success  
To create a meaningful customer segmentation strategy, I define key success metrics that drive growth. My **North Star Metric (NSM)** is based on **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scoring**, providing a structured way to classify customers and track business performance.

#### 📊 When is Success Achieved?  
Success is measured when I can effectively categorize and analyze customer behavior across different segments.  

| **Dimension**         | **View**                                  | **Description**                                           | **Why?** |

### 4️⃣ Prototype – Data Preparation & Visualization

#### 1 Data Selection & Structuring  
- Chose relevant tables and fields from the **data dictionary** based on business objectives.  

#### 2 Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
- Standardized date formats, categorical variables, and numerical fields.  
- Used **SQL for querying and filtering** data efficiently.  
- Applied **Power Query** for data transformation and merging multiple sources.  

#### 3 Data Modeling    
- Created fact and dimension tables to optimize performance.
-  Established Star Schema model.   

#### 4 Developing Measures  
- **Calculated RFM Scores:**  
  - **Recency (R):** Days since last purchase → `Recency = TODAY() - Last_Purchase_Date`  
  - **Frequency (F):** Total purchases → `Frequency = COUNT(DISTINCT Order_ID)`  
  - **Monetary (M):** Total spending → `Monetary = SUM(Total_Spent)`  
  - **Scoring:**  
    - Used **percentile-based ranking** to assign scores from 1 to 5 for Recency (low = better), Frequency, and Monetary (high = better).  
    - Final RFM Score = `R_Score + F_Score + M_Score`.  
    - Stored results in a **Dim table named `Dim_Customer`**, containing customer details and their RFM scores.  
- Applied **DAX** to compute advanced metrics.such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), Average Basket Size, and Revenue per Segment.  

#### 5 Data Exploration & Insights Extraction  
- Used **SQL queries** to identify spending trends, customer behaviors, and purchase patterns.  
- Analyzed customer retention, churn risks, and segment distribution.  

#### 6 Choosing Appropriate Visualizations  
- Selected **Treemaps, Scatter Plot, Line Charts, Pie Charts and Bar Graphs** for intuitive insights.    

#### 7 Dashboard Design & Prototyping  
- Organized reports into logical **views (Customer Overview, Segmentation, Location Analysis, Product Analysis).** 
- Applied **consistent color themes** for clear differentiation.  
- Ensured **user-friendly navigation** for stakeholders.  


###  6️⃣ Test and Implementation:
- Gathered feedback on prototype dashboards.  
- Refined metrics, filters, and visualization choices for better clarity.  
- Validated accuracy by cross-checking against raw data.

# 4. 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations  

## 🔹 Customer Segmentation  
I categorize customers into four main groups to optimize engagement and revenue:  

- **🏆 Top Value (Champions, Loyal)**: High-CLV customers who drive most of the revenue and exhibit the best purchasing behavior.  
- **🔄 Need Retention (Cannot Lose Them, At Risk, Need Attention, Hibernating)**: Contribute significantly to revenue but are showing signs of disengagement.  
- **🚀 Need Conversion (Promising, Potential Loyalist, New Customer)**: New or developing customers with strong potential to become loyal.  
- **⚠️ No Action (About to Sleep, Lost Customer)**: A large segment with minimal revenue contribution and very low CLV.
