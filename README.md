# 📂 Dataset Description & Data Structure

### 📌 Data Source:

- **Source**: Internal company database
- **Format**: `.csv`

## 📊 Data Structure & Relationships  

To effectively analyze sales performance and customer behavior, the dataset was structured into a **star schema**, with **Sales.SalesOrderDetail** serving as the **Fact_Sales** table. This central fact table connects to multiple **dimension tables** to enhance data granularity and improve analytical capabilities. 

The **Fact_Sales** table is at the center of the star schema, connecting to multiple dimension tables via **foreign key relationships**

# 4. 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations  

## 🔹 Customer Segmentation  
I categorize customers into four main groups to optimize engagement and revenue:  

- **🏆 Top Value (Champions, Loyal)**: High-CLV customers who drive most of the revenue and exhibit the best purchasing behavior.  
- **🔄 Need Retention (Cannot Lose Them, At Risk, Need Attention, Hibernating)**: Contribute significantly to revenue but are showing signs of disengagement.  
- **🚀 Need Conversion (Promising, Potential Loyalist, New Customer)**: New or developing customers with strong potential to become loyal.  
- **⚠️ No Action (About to Sleep, Lost Customer)**: A large segment with minimal revenue contribution and very low CLV.
